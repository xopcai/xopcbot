# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Device nicknames
- API endpoints
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
