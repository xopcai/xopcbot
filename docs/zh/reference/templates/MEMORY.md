# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

_Your curated memories — the important stuff that survives across sessions._

## People

_(Names, relationships, preferences)_

## Projects

_(Current work, goals, deadlines)_

## Preferences

_(How your human likes things done)_

## Learned Lessons

_(Mistakes not to repeat, insights worth keeping)_

**Only load this in main sessions (direct chats with your human).**
**DO NOT load in shared contexts like group chats.**

This is your long-term memory. Keep it concise and meaningful.
